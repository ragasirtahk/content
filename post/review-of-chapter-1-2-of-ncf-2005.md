The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 is a revision of the NCF 2000. The document draws its policy basis from ‘Learning Without Burden’ and ‘National Policy on Education (NPE) 1986’. 

It focusses on the reality that learning has become a source of burden and stress on children.The school system is characterised by an inflexibility as it makes learning an isolated activity and discourages creative thinking. Education is seen and received for material success. The examination system forces the students to memorize and reproduce. The textbooks are loaded with information. The need to change the perception of child as a receiver of knowledge is pointed out.  The first chapter of NCF 2005 on 'Perspective of NCF' discusses about these problems. These basic concerns of education are pointed from the Learning without Burden document. The focus is also on broadening the scope of curriculum. The concern of the curriculum design to ensure that children from different backgrounds are able to learn and achieve success in school. Decentralisation and the role of Panchayati Raj Institutions are steps towards systemic reforms. The need to connect classroom knowledge to life experience, to impart knowledge to children from marginalised sections of society so that they can gain same respect among those from privileged section and facilitation of children's experiences and knowledge. The curriculum should be designed in a manner that it enables the children to reinterpret and re-evaluate the past with reference to new priorities. Since democracy is based on the principles of equality, justice, liberty, where each citizen's dignity is given importance. Therefore, democratic education should focus on the full and all round development of every children. J.P. Naik describes equality, quality and quantity as the 'elusive triangle' of Indian education. Representation of knowledge in textbooks should is to be viewed from the perspective of challenges that face humanity. Knowledge that is selected to be included in each subject is to be carefully examined keeping in mind the socio-economic and cultural goals. Quality in education and social justice are the central theme of curricular reform. Inclusion of expectations and aspirations of the poor should also be in the frame of curricular concerns. The concept of knowledge should include new areas of knowledge, promoting participation in pedagogic practices and building self-confidence and critical awareness. The aim of education should be commitment to the values of democracy and therefore, curriculum be planned/made in such a way that it provides adequate experience and space for dialogue and discourse so that such commitment could be build in the children. The chapter also points towards the integration of work with education. Working with others in a spirit of cooperation. The accessibility to schools of children belonging to rural areas and those who belong to marginalised section still remains a problem. The chapter points out these concerns and needs of education. But does not suggest any major policy or measures taken to solve the problems. The chapter is written in a rigid language. 

The chapter two of the 'Learning and knowledge' document focusses on the learning and knowledge. The concern in curriculum development is to make it meaningful experience for children. There is a need to engage with the child centred education. The ability of a student to reproduce the textual knowledge should not be emphasized because they learn by getting in touch with the natural environment surrounding them. The interaction with the environment enables a children to construct knowledge.  Children must be given opportunities to take initiatives. The curriculum should enable to nurture the student’s curiosity. The participation of children in sports, games is also mentioned in this chapter.  But how many schools have playgrounds still remains a question and if they have it then do activities and games happen? Are the students motivated to participate in sports? And also, Do students really participate in classroom discussions? The document focusses on curriculum to develop a holistic approach to learning and child development. Interaction with environment enables a child to construct knowledge. This is neglected in conceptualisation of textbooks. Understanding of a child changes across time and space. The teacher should be given a role in syllabus preparation. But knowledge that enters modern education still remains determined by requirements of the modern state.
