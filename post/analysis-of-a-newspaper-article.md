It is essential for us to have a deeper look into the real scenario behind women’s struggles. The intersectionality of identity, culture, religion, caste, class, institutions and histories determines/influences a girls’ educational path to a larger extent. 

The draft National Education Policy 2019s’ section 6  emphasises on the inclusive and equitable education for all. It focuses on the child’s education that should not be affected by prejudice and bias, based on gender, socio-economic status, circumstances of birth or background. The section describes the Under Represented Groups (URGs) as “those having given gender identities (including women and transgender individuals), given socio-cultural identities (such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs, Muslims, migrant communities), given special needs (such as learning disabilities), and given socio-economic conditions (such as the urban poor).” It states that there exists a large disparity and a considerable decline in overall enrolments among URGs in education at higher secondary level. It states that though policies and schemes have helped to increase the participation of URGs in the schooling system, providing quality education to girls to increase education levels presently and for future generations and a need to change in school culture, in school curriculum.  

The section 6 of draft NEP 2019 emphasises the need for equality in education. So it becomes necessary for us to analyse and understand the goals of girls education (as to why and what is the need for girls’ education, what do we actually want education to provide/equip girls with). And further, in order to conceptualise the goals of girls’ education, we must try to understand education of girls with attention to caste, religion, location, identities in the context of social and educational inequality in contemporary India. These, infact, can be called as factors playing an essential role in socialisation of girls since childhood and in shaping their education. The stage of socialisation is marked by learning, submission, inferior status and fears (Kumar 2017). Fears of injury to body, to sexuality, fear of freedom, fears of meeting the perception of ‘ideal women’ are related to consequences with respect to matrimony. Education, in this context, is the knowledge to understand the social milieu. It requires an individual who thinks, reflects, compares and contrasts. Now, let us have a look at how different factors affect girls’ education.

Religion –  Zoya Hasan and Ritu Menon (2005) point out in their study, Muslim girls are still less educated as compared to other religions. Their participation in schools is lower than other communities’ girls. But Muslims perceive education to be the main chance of upward mobility. Zoya tries to map the reasons for low enrolment rates of girls in education. These are financial constraints, poverty, poorer households dependent on labour of children, high cost of education, high cost of tuition and coaching center fees, the head of the family being illiterate. Girls are more likely to be withdrawn from schools in such situations. A girls’ dropout is determined by the social and economic characteristics of household. Social norms, such as early marriage, unwillingness to accept school discipline, inflexibility of school system and textbook teaching which does not take into account the work patterns of home are barriers for a girl in assessing education. Poor quality of school infrastructure, poor teaching unsuitable school timings, irregular attendance by teachers, lack of toilets, location of schools being far from residence, unavailability of Urdu teaching-learning material, problems with adopting a bilingual approach (Hindi and Urdu) to teaching are other reasons that constraint women education. Moreover, schooling in Urdu medium schools is perceived as giving less opportunities for higher education and white-collar jobs. Thus, Muslims choose Hindi and English medium schools upon Urdu schools for children’s education. Also, some families prefer religious education over secular education which results in late entry of Muslim girls into school which ultimately results in drop-out after middle school due to social norm of marriage and patriarchal ideology. Muslims also do not prefer higher education because of engagement in traditionally structured and skilled manual labour. They fear of being discriminated and limited opportunities in getting a government job. 

Caste - Womens’ lives are also shaped by caste. Relationship between women is differentiated by dominant and subordinate caste locations. The insertion of women into social structures and institutions is preferred by caste locations. It defines the boundary of sexual division of labour, specifies, sets limits, puts restrictions on who can access and not access, speak and not  speak, and in front of whom and when. There is regulation by caste in such a way that it determines for women how much to study, whom to marry, maintaining caste purity (endogamy), maintaining gender hierarchies. Caste is interrelated with religion and class ideologies and are reshaped by different social positions (Arur 2019). Caste and gender construct social hierarchies and it is education which can serve a purpose to perpetuate and resist these inequalities. Modern schooling produces insecurities and concerns   for girls’ safety. For example, educated girls likely to move towards inter-caste relationships, girls might run away with a different caste boy or there might be physical and psychological oppression of lower caste by upper caste girls. Thus, as noted by Shailja Paik, Dalit girls are subject to discrimination, control, regulation, surveillance of both state services and family. Concepts of violence (physical, mental, symbolic, epistemological, social and cultural), visibility and invisibility in a classroom (of caste), belongingness have been brought up by her in her work. 

Educational Institutions - Schools and classrooms also regulate social divisions. Instances such as lower caste girls being suppressed by teachers, not allowing them to put forward their views, no active participation by Dalit girls, separate registers for Dalit students, concessions given to lower caste students being publicly announced in classrooms which make them shy, corporal punishments, low expectations by teachers and superimposing of a new culture of ideas , dress code, language, food habits onto lower caste girls have been sited from her interview data. 

Goals of girls’ education –  Though we have to keep all the above mentioned factors in conceptualising and determining the goals of education for a girl, it is time to keep in mind the effect of schooling on other factors if we really wish to empower girls. Nandini Manjekar (2003) draws out attention towards the education facing right-wing reaction, privatisation and market influence. The NCF 2000 is in stark contrast to NEP 1986, in the sense that religious education has permeated all sections of NCF. It focusses on values derived from religion. Religion, in itself, curbs and controls the sexuality, labour and individuality of women. So, there is a need for intensive monitoring of new developments which are likely to impact girls’ education.   The statist goals of women education, which see women as instrumentalist can be -  to make women independent, for contributing towards nation building, work as agents of development, in population control, serving motherhood roles, helping children to become good citizens, etc. 

The counter-goals to these can be- 

1. To enable women to recognise their potential as an individual.
2. To make them aware of their freedom of choices, desires, agency, autonomy. 
3. To avoid inescapability.
4. To develop an ability to understand the world around. To question and resist inequality of social structure.
5. To enable them to make linkages between lived realities and larger structure and ideologies that they are located in. 
6. Education is a means to obtain entry into the social world while ensuring existence in the physical (Kumar 2017).
