Paulo Freire in his ‘fourth letter’ on the indispensable ‘qualities of progressive teacher’for their better performance introduces us to the attributes he thinks a progressive teacher should acquire. According to him, these are acquired through practice. 

The first is humility which requires courage, self-confidence, self-respect and respect for others. One must always be ready to teach and to learn. A teacher should not be assertive or of commanding nature. Understanding students’ point of view is important is as important as teaching them new things. For example – When a teacher teaches new topic in class and also asks each student about his/her understanding of the topic and listens to their views also. 

The second quality is lovingness. The teacher should love both students and the process of teaching. The teacher should enjoy the teaching and this is called the joy of living. An example of this can be when the teacher compliments students for their good work, praises them. Paying close attention to childrens' moods, facial expressions and what they say is also an gesture of showing love towards them. 

The third quality is courage. It means courage to conquer the fears. A teacher should not deny his/her fears or surrender themselves to it. One must control them. For example – courage can be developed by believing in our abilities and overcoming our negativities. A teacher needs to work on itself by analysing that is he/she being a good teacher and if feels lack of anything in his/her personality, one must work on it. Similarly, a teacher instills value of courage in students by assigning them different tasks such as projects, presentations, leadership roles(monitor of class),etc.

 The fourth quality is tolerance. It signifies to live with the different, to learn from and respect the different. Tolerance requires freedom, respect, discipline and ethics. It makes us coherent with our democratic political choice. Hence, we can’t be democratic without it. When a teacher listens to views of each student and accepts them without necessarily asserting his own is an example of tolerance. 

The fifth is decisiveness. It signifies one's ability to make decisions because it is a kind of choice that requires careful evaluation. Democratic education includes the responsibility of making decisions.

 The sixth quality is security. It means confidence in one's actions. 

The seventh is wisdom. Wisdom to use both patience impatience to work patiently impatient. For example – When you have given some assignment and it’s the deadline day. When you enter the classroom you find that some students have not done their work. As a teacher you might be annoyed by this situation but you need to exercise wisdom in this case and be patient and give the remaining students another deadline but in a little stricter manner than earlier. Verbal Parsimony is eighth quality which shows the ability to exercise power of words and how to use them responsibly for maximum effect. 

In the end of this letter Freire emphasises on the need to inculcate all these qualities so that a school can be called good school. We all need to face the challenges of the school system and fight for the rights – the rights of openly expressing ourselves (not feeling burdened ) as teachers, right to freedom in teaching, the right to better conditions for pedagogical work, the right to serious and coherent and to not to have to lie to survive.
