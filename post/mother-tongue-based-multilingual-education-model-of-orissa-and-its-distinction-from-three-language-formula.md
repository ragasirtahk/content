Orissa launched the mother-tongue based multilingual education for tribal children in 10 tribal languages in the year 2006. It started with children of grade 1 with 195 schools selected in 2007. The total number of schools under this programme was 495 in 2009. (Mohanty, Mishra, Reddy and Ramesh, 2009, pp. 293).  The schools that were selected had almost 100% children who speak a tribal language. The 10 languages are Bonda, Juang, Koya, Munda, Kui, Kuvi, Oram, Kishan, Santali and Saura,    Following are some features of this programme-

1. For each of the 10 languages, teachers, language resource persons, community leaders, writers, artists were selected from the tribal communities for designing and content of textbooks and teaching-learning materials. These include cultural daily life experiences, stories, songs, games from these communities represented in the form of curriculum, pictures and illustrations. Sometimes, the activities are also taken in community settings. In designing the curriculum, national and state curriculum is followed by the theme web approach. The sequences of the themes is according to the calendar approach. The academic year is divided into 3 terms. Each term into 10 weeks. And each week into 1 theme.
2. Manuals have been developed for all MLE teachers and are given specific training. Different teacher training programmes, workshops, seminars and conferences are conducted by OPEPA for successful implementation of MLE programme.
3. The programme is monitored by state MLE project cells and community. 
4. The tribal mother tongue is the only medium of instruction/language of teaching for all school subjects till grade 3. Oriya, the state language is introduced as language 2 (L2) orally from grade 2 onwards. Reading and writing in Oriya (L2) starts from grade 3. Oral English (as language 3) is also introduced in grade 3. In grade 4, Oriya is the only medium of instruction for all subjects and tribal mother tongue becomes a language subject. Reading and writing in English (L3) starts in grade 4. There is no plan to use mother tongue after grade 5. The MLE children are expected to join the schools in which Oriya is the medium of instruction/language of teaching for all subjects (except language subjects) in grade 6. “The school subjects include Language and Mathematics from Grade I onwards. Environmental Studies as a curricular area is included from Grade I (as a part of the Language Text Book for Grades I and II and then as a separate subject from Grade III onwards) in Orissa”.(Mohanty et al.,2009, p.293)   
5. The strategies adopted for learning in the programme are – Two mega strategies and two track strategies. The mega strategies include Skill based development which means Confidence and competence through practice with engagement. The second is meaning based contextualised learning which emphasizes creativity and is rooted in background and culture of the learner. The track strategies consist of CALPS (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency Skill) and BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication Skill). The students acquire proficiency in CALPS through use of alphabet charts, alphabet books, number chart, number book, math books and in BICS through use of Big book, small book, listening story, experience story, EVS (nature study), games and sports, songs, tales, riddles etc. 

The programme adopted by Orissa is an example of multilingual education and not three language formula adopted by other schools. According to the three language formula-  The first language that students should study be mother tongue or the regional language. The second language should be – in Hindi speaking states, it will be English or some other language belonging to modern India. In non-Hindi states, it would be English or Hindi.  The third language should be, in Hindi speaking states, it would be English or some other language belonging to modern India, but the one that is not chosen as the second language In non-Hindi states, it would be English or some other language belonging to modern India, but not the one chosen as the second language. 
A multilingual education focusses on development and revitalisation of languages. The primary focus of multilingual education is quality education for minorities, tribal and indigenous people. Mohanty, Panda, Phillipson & Skutnabb-Kangas (2009) understand multilingual education (MLE) as “the use of two or more languages (including Sign languages) as media of instruction in subjects other than the languages themselves  and with (high levels of) multilingualism and, preferably, multiliteracy, as a goal at the end of formal schooling”(p. xvii). 
So, whereas in the three language formula the focus is on educating students in Hindi as well, the MLE tries to focus on introducing the students to other state dominant languages while along with the mother tongue of the child. Another distinction that can be made is that the adoption of 3 language formula by most of the schools in North India is such that L1 referred to as the longest language subject studied in school, i.e., till grade 12. L2 is till grade 10 and L3 is till grade 8. L1 usually tends to be English, L2 as Hindi, L3 as other foreign languages , such as , French, German, Spanish, Sanskrit, etc. So, if we compare this with MLE, then also the distinction lies in the fact that MLE somehow keeps the child more educated in his/her regional/mother tongue language. Also, in a 3 language formula, the medium of instruction is English in most schools in Northern India and is Hindi if the school is hindi-medium. In a MLE classroom, medium of instruction can vary from mother tongue to state dominant language or be bilingual or multilingual. 

The model of MLE reflected in Orissa’s programme is transition model. It is early exit transition model. In a transition model, the teaching starts with mother tongue and gradually shifts to dominant language as medium of instruction (MoI). Such models use non-dominant language to introduce dominant language and then the non-dominant language does not exist(neither as medium of instruction nor as a school subject). When the child acquires some fluency in dominant language, then the use of non-dominant language is stopped as soon as possible. The mother tongue is used till grade 1 or 2 in an early transition model. According to Benson (2009), “the L1 is used only or mainly as a bridge to the L2 and is not necessarily seen as an end in itself” (p. 67). The Orissa model resembles this type as in that also, the mother tongue(L1) of the tribal child is language of teaching till grade 3 and dominant state language, Odiya(L2), is introduced from class 2 onwards. In grade 4, Odiya becomes the sole language of instruction and the tribal mother tongue becomes a language subject. In this process, the mother tongue is not at all used as MoI or language subject after grade 5. Hence, “the knowledge of language, literacy and concepts learned in the L1 can be accessed and used in the L2 once oral L2 skills are developed, with no relearning required; this is known as the process of transfer” (Benson, 2009, p. 67). And, in a transition model , the type of learners are of from the non-dominant language/ culture and MoI goes from non-dominant language to dominant language which is evident in Orissa's model also.
