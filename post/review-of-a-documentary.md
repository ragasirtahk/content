'Schooling the World - White Man’s last burden' (2010) is a documentary by Carol Black. She is an American writer and filmmaker. It is shot in the Ladakh region of India. The people of Ladakh believe and practice Buddhist culture. The documentary is an attempt towards bringing out the impacts of institutional education on the Ladakh population. It is about how the modern education / education system introduced by colonisers has made the present generation of students to pull away from their own culture. When America moved towards West, thousands of Native American children were forcibly sent to government-run boarding schools. In the commencement speech of Carlisle Indian School, it was said that “Let all that is Indian within you die”. It is evident from this comment that the American’s overt goal of introducing education to Indians was to “create a class of persons Indian in blood and colour but English in taste,in opinions,…”, as said by Macaulay, that is, to prepare a workforce for colonisers that could help them in clerical works. Thus they introduced teaching of English and Westernisation in the new education system.  

The interviews of various people in Ladakh tells that each one of them is pointing towards the functioning of schools like factories. Students are put in schools as raw materials and come out as products that can meet the demands an urban culture.  Putting in the words of Helena Norberg Hodge, “Education has created a human monoculture in which the same curriculum is being taught all around the world which has destroyed the unique human culture”.   But in this whole process, the qualities of kindness, co-operation and of helping others which were instilled in children by the teachings of Buddha have now started to decline. The traditional education focussed on spiritual learning but the modern education has a focus on preparing the child for the market demands. Parents also send their children to school so that they can achieve good job opportunities. Education is now related to material success. The present education system instills feelings of competition and meritocracy in students. There is pressure to learn faster and to outshine others. Traditionally, every child knew about their culture, they knew how to manage everything, but since the introduction of institutional education, the children did not know how to survive in their own culture. These are the some of unpredictable effects of modern education as compared to traditional education. Children have to leave their hometown in search of a job and hence they get separated from their own cultures and traditions.

The introduction of  English as a compulsory school subject in secondary school and as a medium of instruction and examination has put students in a difficult situation of grasping rather than learning. Moreover, the poems about English seasons appear unrelated to Indian climate. This is an example of how students tend to memorize rather than finding meaning in texts. Examination system has made students to adorn the skills of reproduction which tests the students’ capacity to memorize. This kills the students motivation to learn. In a classroom instruction, textbooks are the dominant tool of pedagogy followed by teachers and in such a situation a child is expected to be obedient and therefore, qualities like energy, spontaneity, originality, creativity and courage are lost. Putting in words of Gatto, there is a lack of understanding in a student-teacher and children-parent relationship where elder must accept and trust the genuineness of a childs’ intentions. Children are blocked from exploring and being innovative in the process of schooling as they are made to follow prescribed syllabus and are served everything readymade which they have to grasp in order to reach next class. The another problem in present education system is the drop-out rate which remains unaffected by all the progress claimed in the area of elementary education. The reason for this being the poverty and the need for children belonging to poor families to look for labour as early as possible so as to financially support the family. The other major problem is the existence of two parallel streams of schools – Common schools which depend on state for school education and Exclusive schools in which education is paid for by parents. The presence of both of these types of schools creates a separation of the children belonging to middle / rich families from the children of the poor. The other problem is the physical condition of schools and the poor quality of buildings in many regions of the country. Teacher training is still untouched by an academic grounding in child centred pedagogy. The central concern of the documentary engages with the value system underlying the modern schooling.
