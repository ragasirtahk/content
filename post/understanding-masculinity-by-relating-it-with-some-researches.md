The article tries to interrogate how boys are made boys by the social practices of masculinity at institutional sites. There are various ways in which is the term ‘masculinity’ can be understood. Masculinity can be referred to as a social structure, a social relation which involves hierarchies about power, privileges, marginality, ideologies and characteristics. Masculinity can also be studied in relation to consequences and effects for self and other genders. It is defined in relation to femininity. It is different from femininity as both binaries are defined by various characteristics such as way of speaking, behaviour, type of interaction,  division of work, claims, entitlements, roles and responsibilities in public and private spheres.  A boy is made to conform/inherit in him the characteristics of masculine since childhood. 

Institutional spaces such as schools, family, textbooks and public spaces influence and shape in them the masculine traits. Family plays a central role in shaping our gendered self as it is the primary agent of socialisation. It is here that a boy learns the social roles, expectations and behaviours that makes him a boy. School is the secondary site of socialisation which plays a major role in shaping the identities of the gendered self. It is here that children learn from textbooks and interactions within their peers and teachers the heterosexual masculinities. Apart from this, the qualities of masculinity such as being dominant, aggressive, strong, bold, independence, strength, courage, assertiveness are imbibed by a boy that makes him a boy. 

According to Kalia(1986), textbooks analysed by him had men as dominant figures, he shares instances of men abusing and violently beating women in lesson plots, sexist language of textbooks, men being depicted as dominant decision makers. Textbooks give more voice and visibility to men. It legitimises patriarchal and dominant structure. The school spaces, playgrounds and children’s talk become the sites of doing so. 

 According to Martino et al., (2003), such systems and spaces can be manipulated by students to further accentuate the differences and use them as markers of power and marginality.  Martino et al., (2003) in their book try to address issues of masculinity and schooling through mestizaje and foucauldian theoretical frameworks. The factors that shape boys’ masculinity are self-regulation practices, labels, communities they belong to and normalising practices.  The formation of identity during schooling period is understood as a “cultural technology for working on and fashioning of gendered self.” The boys’ ethnicity, socio-economic status, indigenity, rurality, sexuality,disability and most importantly physical build and looks , clothes have a role in shaping masculine trait. Social ascription, community acknowledgment and personal agency play a role in determining what gender does one belongs to. The body has a role in two ways - 

1. “The body as the site of normalizing practices and constructions of masculinity: boys’ understandings of the ‘normal’ body of masculinity, including muscularity, modes of walking and talking.
2. Body fashioning/adornment as signifiers of ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ masculinity: boys’ understandings of how clothes, jewellery, make-up and other self-fashioning techniques define their masculinities.” (Martino et al.,2003, p. 15) 

   Hence, one can explore various theoritical frameworks at such institutional spaces which have an influenec in shaping boys' masculinity.
